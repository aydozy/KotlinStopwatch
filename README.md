# Stopwatch - Understanding "Runnable"

The `Runnable` interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a `thread`.

## About App
A simple stopwatch app. There is a 'textView' showing the time and 2 buttons. Including Start and Stop.
When the application is first opened, it shows time: 0.
- After pressing the `start button`, the time starts to increase and the start button becomes inactive.
- After pressing the `stop button`, the time is reset and the stop button becomes inactive.
